# Simplest Launcher
A tiny Python script that is able to run about anything by a click a on a button that you would otherwise run from a command line.
Just one file, containing code and config. You could add the script as a launcher on a panel on your Linux Desktop.
Edit the script and fill in your config to the array called elements in the beginning of the code.

The fields of the array have the following meaning
    Window row for the button to appear
    Window columns for the button to appear
    Number of columns for the button to span
    Number of rows for the button to span
    Horizontal alignment for the button label (0.0 = left, 0.5 = center, 1.0 = right)
    Label text
    Command to be executed
