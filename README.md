# Simplest Launcher
A tiny Python script that allows you to run anything by a click a on a button that you would otherwise run from a command line.
Just one file, containing code and config. You could add the script as a launcher on a panel on your Linux Desktop.
Edit the script and fill in your config to the array called elements in the beginning of the code.

The fields of the array have the following meaning:
1. Window row for the button to appear
1. Window columns for the button to appear
1. Number of columns for the button to span
1. Number of rows for the button to span
1. Horizontal alignment for the button label (0.0 = left, 0.5 = center, 1.0 = right)
1. Label text
1. Command to be executed
